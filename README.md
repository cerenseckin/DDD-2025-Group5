## [Project title]

### Data Collection
## - Where did you get your data from? [sources/s link]
 
 We used a combination of: 
    - Academic archaeological sources 
    - Public encyclopedic databases
    - Ancient astronaut /paleocontact literature 
    - Open web sources (YouTube documentaries, forums and blogs, UFO archives) 

The initial dataset of achaelogical sites eas compiled manually based on publicly accessible resurces including; 

    - Wikipedia 
    - UNESCO World Heritage listings
    - Archaeology magazines 
    - Cultural heritage dtabases
    - Popular ancient-astronaut media
    - Public UFO reporting archives

We also created a structured spreadsheet that contains all final variables derived from these sources.

## - What's your data about? [describe]


We used a combination of:

- Academic archaeological sources
- Public encyclopedic databases
- Ancient astronaut / paleocontact literature
- Open web sources (documentaries, forums, UFO archives)

The initial dataset of archaeological sites was compiled manually based on publicly accessible sources, including:

- Wikipedia
- UNESCO World Heritage listings
- Archaeology magazines
- Cultural heritage databases
- Popular ancient-astronaut media
- Public UFO reporting archives

We  also created a structured spreadsheet that contains all final variables derived from these sources. 

## - What's your data about?


Our data describes a curated selection of archaeologically significant sites that:
- have unexplained or debated construction features,
- frequently appear in ancient-astronaut and paleocontact narratives,
- or are associated with myths of extraterrestrial presence.

For each site, our dataset captures:

- approximate creation date,
- type of intervention attributed to extraterrestrials in popular narratives (construction, knowledge, concept),
- presence or absence of alien sightings,
- estimated global sea level at the time of creation (to contextualize the site environmentally),
- and the category of “energy” or alien activity (passive, active field, earth alignment).

The dataset is not about proving alien contact; it’s about understanding how cultural imagination, archaeological ambiguity, and speculative narratives intersect.

 ## - Who is/are the sources/creators of your data?

Because this dataset mixes academic information and cultural narratives, the “sources” are diverse:
- Archaeologists and researchers who publish on these sites
- Scientific papers providing dating, stratigraphy, and environmental context
- Cultural historians and mythologists
- Popular writers within ancient astronaut theory (e.g., fringe media, documentaries, UFO forums)
- Global sea-level reconstructions by paleoclimate scientists
- Popular media creators on social platforms (videos by YouTube)

Ultimately, we created the compiled dataset: we selected, cleaned, reinterpreted, and structured the information for this project.


### Data Organisation

 - Have you combined different data from different sources? How did you merge them?</li>

Yes. We merged several categories of data into one unified sheet:
    - We started with the basic archaeological facts of each site, such as name and location 
    - we added some notes about the kind of intervention that the aliens did in each site and the reason why that specific place is interesting for alien activity
    - It was important for us to see the date this sites are believed to have been created as time framing is important to understand when this aliens may have spent time on Earth.
    - We looked for the global sea levels in the period of creation of each site to give context as to how was Earth in those periods, what was happening and what was the environment like. 
    - We looked for different records to know if there have been sightings in each site and categorized them as yes/no
    - Lastly, we looked for the kind of "energy" measured in each site through scientific articles and studies performed by various scientists on-site. They manipulate acoustics, magnetism or piezoelectricity to record the magnetic anomalies  "measurable physical interactions". 
    It is believed that ancient structures interact with their environmenty: some are symbolic, some are geometric, some user acoustics or physical properties of stone. 
    
To merge them we:

    - standardized all site names so they matched across sources.
    - converted dates into comparable approximate ranges (BCE/CE).
    - matched each site to its corresponding sea-level estimate using paleoclimate time maps.
    - harmonized different interpretations of the "received help" into consistent categories (construction, knowledge, concept) that represent what are the themes where there may have been alien intervention.

This produced a single coherent dataset where every row corresponds to one archaeological site.

## - What columns are more relevant for your project?</li>

The most relevant columns are:
    1- Creation Date: to situate each site in time
    2- Sea Level: to contextualize the environmental moment
    3- Help Type (construction / knowledge / concept): core narrative layer
    4- Alien Seen? (yes/no): sociocultural layer
    5- Energy Type (passive / active field)

These are the variables visualised in the final circular diagram.

## - Have you used any AI-based tool to understand and manipulate your data? if yes, what and how?
 
 Yes. We used AI (ChatGPT) in the following ways:

    - To isolate the sites that were interesting enough to add on our database based on the ancien astronaut theories
    - To confirm archaeological dates, synthesizing information from multiple reliable sources
    - To derive sea-level values for each date, using known paleoclimate curves, and to find some specific sites where to find this data
    - To organize the conceptual categories, such as types of alien help or types of “energy”
    - To help clean and standardize information, ensuring consistency across the dataset

However, the core dataset was curated manually and all values were checked or adjusted for coherence. AI was used as a support tool to research and organize, not a data generator

### General inspirational questions

This are some of the questions that we first discused along with some notes about our decision and thoughts regarding each one of them: 

#### Alien traces in human evolution history: (Chosen theme)

We started thinking about the overall alien traces in human history and evolution, and this took us to various themes: archeological sites, weird ancient drawings and other unexplicable phenomena related to different specific places in the world. 

We also thought about the legends of mythological creatures (that may have been aliens) but left that path to finally chose the archeological sites, which we found more interesting and representative of human evolution and alien intervention. 

#### Can we assume that mythological creatures are aliens?
#### What does "alien" mean?
#### Are mythological creatures inspired by an alien presence in human evolution history?
#### Did aliens have anything to do with human evolution?
### Where does the missing chromosome come from?
