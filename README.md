## Abstract 

This project explores how enigmatic archaeological sites intersect with narratives of extraterrestrial intervention. Combining archaeological data, cultural myths, and speculative categories, we create a circular timeline mapping perceived alien influences across ancient history.

Our protocol begins with collecting heterogeneous data on archaeologically ambiguous sites: creation dates, cultural context, alien-related narratives, and environmental indicators. We clean and categorize this data into intervention types, sighting status, and temporal markers. Finally, we transform these variables into a circular visual system that integrates chronology, environmental context, and speculative alien activity.

## What topic does the project address?

The project investigates how human cultures interpret unexplained ancient sites through the lens of extraterrestrial narratives. It explores the intersection of archaeology, cultural memory, and paleocontact speculation, asking how data, myth, and imagination co-produce meaning around these “enigmatic” locations.
By situating each site within its historical moment and corresponding Holocene sea-level conditions, the project examines how archaeological ambiguity, planetary context, and cultural imagination intersect to shape beliefs about paleocontact.

## What data have you considered?

We collected data on a curated selection of archaeologically significant sites that frequently appear in ancient-astronaut theories or extraterrestrial folklore. For each site, we gathered: creation period, type of alleged alien intervention (concept, knowledge, construction), alien activity mode (passive, earth alignment, active field), presence or absence of sightings, and a contextual sea-level estimate.

This dataset combines archaeological information, fringe narratives, and environmental data to explore how diverse forms of evidence are woven together in popular speculation.

### Link to the dataset

## What does the visualisation show?

The visualization is structured as a circular diagram in which archaeological sites are arranged in chronological order along a clockwise path. Each site is represented by a segmented “bubble” that encodes the type of extraterrestrial intervention associated with it—such as conceptual influence, knowledge transmission, or construction support. A blue wave running through the center visualizes the environmental context by showing relative sea-level conditions at the time each site was created.

Radiating outward, each site bubble includes a central symbol indicating whether alien sightings have been reported in connection with the site. The lines connecting sites to the central timeline distinguish between normal states (straight lines) and locations where abnormal or speculative “energy fields” are referenced in paleocontact narratives (wavy lines).

Temporal direction is indicated by a circular band whose line weight gradually increases: the thinnest point marks the oldest period, while the thickest point corresponds to the most recent.


## Conclusion 

While our visualization does not provide evidence of extraterrestrial intervention, it reveals how easily archaeological ambiguity, environmental context, and cultural myth-making intertwine. By placing each mysterious site along a shared timeline and sea-level wave, we highlight the coincidences, gaps, and resonances that fuel paleocontact narratives.
The result is not a proof of alien impact, but a map of how humans construct meaning: connecting distant sites across vast eras, projecting intelligence onto stone, and imagining contact where scientific certainty fades.
Ultimately, our project shows that extraterrestrial narratives tell us less about aliens and far more about ourselves—our need for explanation, our fascination with the unknown, and our tendency to search for patterns across the deep history of our planet.

### Data Organisation

 - Have you combined different data from different sources? How did you merge them?</li>

Yes. We merged several categories of data into one unified sheet:
    - We started with the basic archaeological facts of each site, such as name and location 
    - we added some notes about the kind of intervention that the aliens did in each site and the reason why that specific place is interesting for alien activity
    - It was important for us to see the date this sites are believed to have been created as time framing is important to understand when this aliens may have spent time on Earth.
    - We looked for the global sea levels in the period of creation of each site to give context as to how was Earth in those periods, what was happening and what was the environment like. 
    - We looked for different records to know if there have been sightings in each site and categorized them as yes/no
    - Lastly, we looked for the kind of "energy" measured in each site through scientific articles and studies performed by various scientists on-site. They manipulate acoustics, magnetism or piezoelectricity to record the magnetic anomalies  "measurable physical interactions". 
    It is believed that ancient structures interact with their environmenty: some are symbolic, some are geometric, some user acoustics or physical properties of stone. 
    
To merge them we:

    - standardized all site names so they matched across sources.
    - converted dates into comparable approximate ranges (BCE/CE).
    - matched each site to its corresponding sea-level estimate using paleoclimate time maps.
    - harmonized different interpretations of the "received help" into consistent categories (construction, knowledge, concept) that represent what are the themes where there may have been alien intervention.

This produced a single coherent dataset where every row corresponds to one archaeological site.

## - Have you used any AI-based tool to understand and manipulate your data? if yes, what and how?
 
Yes. We used AI (ChatGPT) to isolate the sites that were interesting, to confirm archaeological dates, to derive sea-level values for each date, to organize the conceptual categories and to help clean and standardize information, ensuring consistency across the dataset
However, the core dataset was curated manually and all values were checked or adjusted for coherence. AI was used as a support tool to research and organize, not a data generator

### General inspirational questions

This are some of the questions that we first discused along with some notes about our decision and thoughts regarding each one of them: 

#### Alien traces in human evolution history: (Chosen theme)

We started thinking about the overall alien traces in human history and evolution, and this took us to various themes: archeological sites, weird ancient drawings and other unexplicable phenomena related to different specific places in the world. 

We also thought about the legends of mythological creatures (that may have been aliens) but left that path to finally chose the archeological sites, which we found more interesting and representative of human evolution and alien intervention. 

#### Can we assume that mythological creatures are aliens?
#### Are mythological creatures inspired by an alien presence in human evolution history?
#### Did aliens have anything to do with human evolution?
#### Where does the missing chromosome come from?
