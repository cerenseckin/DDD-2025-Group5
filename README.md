## [Project title]

### Data Collection
 - Where did you get your data from? [sources/s link]

We used a combination of:

- Academic archaeological sources
- Public encyclopedic databases
- Ancient astronaut / paleocontact literature
- Open web sources (documentaries, forums, UFO archives)

The initial dataset of archaeological sites was compiled manually based on publicly accessible sources, including:

- Wikipedia
- UNESCO World Heritage listings
- Archaeology magazines
- Cultural heritage databases
- Popular ancient-astronaut media
- Public UFO reporting archives

We  also created a structured spreadsheet that contains all final variables derived from these sources. (File used: “UNEXPLAINED ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES – DATASET_3.pdf” .)

 - What's your data about?

Our data describes a curated selection of archaeologically significant sites that:
- have unexplained or debated construction features,
- frequently appear in ancient-astronaut and paleocontact narratives,
- or are associated with myths of extraterrestrial presence.

For each site, our dataset captures:
1- approximate creation date,
2- type of intervention attributed to extraterrestrials in popular narratives (construction, knowledge, concept),
3- presence or absence of alien sightings,
4- estimated global sea level at the time of creation (to contextualize the site environmentally),
5- and the category of “energy” or alien activity (passive, active field, earth alignment).

The dataset is not about proving alien contact; it’s about understanding how cultural imagination, archaeological ambiguity, and speculative narratives intersect.

 - Who is/are the sources/creators of your data?

Because this dataset mixes academic information and cultural narratives, the “sources” are diverse:
- Archaeologists and researchers who publish on these sites
- Scientific papers providing dating, stratigraphy, and environmental context
- Cultural historians and mythologists
- Popular writers within ancient astronaut theory (e.g., fringe media, documentaries, UFO forums)
- Global sea-level reconstructions by paleoclimate scientists

Ultimately, we created the compiled dataset: we selected, cleaned, reinterpreted, and structured the information for this project.

### Data Organisation
 - Have you combined different data from different sources? How did you merge them?

Yes.
We merged several categories of data into one unified sheet:
1- Archaeological facts
(site name, location, creation date)
2- Cultural / mythological interpretations
(type of alien help, alien sighting yes/no)
3- Environmental data
(sea level at time of creation)
4- Speculative categories
(energy activity type)

To merge them we:

- standardized all site names so they matched across sources.
- converted dates into comparable approximate ranges (BCE/CE).
- matched each site to its corresponding sea-level estimate using paleoclimate time maps.
- harmonized different interpretations into consistent categories (construction, knowledge, concept).

This produced a single coherent dataset where every row corresponds to one archaeological site.
   
 - What columns are more relevant for your project?

The most relevant columns are:
1- Creation Date — to situate each site in time
2- Sea Level — to contextualize the environmental moment
3 -Help Type (construction / knowledge / concept) — core narrative layer
4- Alien Seen? (yes/no) — sociocultural layer
5- Energy Type (passive / earth alignment / active field) — speculative framing

These are the variables visualised in the final circular diagram.
 
 - Have you used any AI-based tool to understand and manipulate your data? if yes, what and how?</li>

Yes.We used AI (ChatGPT) in the following ways:

- To confirm archaeological dates, synthesizing information from multiple reliable sources
- To derive sea-level values for each date, using known paleoclimate curves
- To organize the conceptual categories, such as types of alien help or types of “energy”
- To help clean and standardize information, ensuring consistency across the dataset
- To support conceptual interpretation, particularly in clarifying how environmental context and mythological narratives interact

However, the core dataset was curated manually and all values were checked or adjusted for coherence. AI was used as a support tool, not a data generator


### General inspirational questions

#### Alien traces in human evolution history:
- archeological sites without (yet) human explanation
- weird super all drawings representing the same figures all around the world
- Nazca lines

#### Can we assume that mythological creatures are aliens?
What does "alien" mean?

#### Are mythological creatures inspired by an alien presence in human evolution history?

#### Did aliens have anything to do with human evolution?
Where does the missing chromosome come from?
